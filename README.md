# CASIOClient
C wrapper for Steinberg's ASIO API

SDK not included, you'll need to download from here: https://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developers.html

... then place the extracted folder (ASIOSDK2.3) at the root level of the project.

Check out the LibraryTest.cpp file for a simple example of how to use it. Nothin' fancy.
